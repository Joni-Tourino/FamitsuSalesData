  <h1>Let's have a deep dive on Animal Crossing: New Horizons numbers in 2020</h1>
  <p>Without a single doubt, Nintendo's latest game in Animal Crossing's franchise was the game of the year, at least sales wise. Tom Nook and company were able to beat long standing records set by the biggest franchise in Japan: Pokemon. And to explain them all, what better way to do it inside the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p>

    <h2>Other stats to explain the success of the game</h2>
    <p> Nintendo's numbers come from their second quarter <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html">financial report</a>. As stated, those numbers do include digital sales, which means that by end of September, the game had managed to sell around 2,4 million copies on the Nintendo eShop. Almost one in three games were then sold digitally.</p>
    <p>Only with Japan's sales only, New Horizons is shy of 4 million (counting Nintendo's numbers) from Animal Crossing: New Leaf's 12 million worldwide. And the 3DS version was the best selling game of the franchise.</p>
    <p>Animal Crossing was the best starting game for the Nintendo Switch, but it also was the best first week for any Nintendo game that is not Pokemon. And is now the <a href="https://twitter.com/oscarlemaire/status/1242766816151306240">10th best first week</a> since 1995. Pokemon Black/White still holds the record with more than 2,6 million games sold in 2010.</p>
