<h1>Let's have a deep dive on Animal Crossing: New Horizons numbers in 2020</h1><br>

<p>Without a single doubt, Nintendo's latest game in Animal Crossing's franchise was the game of the year, at least sales wise.
Tom Nook and company were able to beat long standing records set by the biggest franchise in Japan: Pokemon.
And to explain some of them, what better way to do it inside the world of Animal Crossing: New Horizons.</p><br>

    <br><h2>Other stats to explain the success of the game</h2><br>
    
<p>Nintendo's numbers come from their second quarter <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html">financial report</a>.
As stated, those numbers do include digital sales, which means that by end of September, the game had managed to sell around 2,4 million copies on the Nintendo eShop.
Almost one in three games were then sold digitally.
This is still far away from almost half of digital sales for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2019-07-31-nearly-half-of-eas-unit-sales-are-now-digital">Electronic Arts'</a> videogames worldwide.</p><br>

<p>Animal Crossing New Leaf, for the Nintendo 3DS, was the best selling game in the franchise.
Worldwide sales put it close to 12,5 million copies sold.
With Japan's sales alone, New Horizons is currently 4,4 million (counting Nintendo's numbers) away from the previous game.</p><br>
    
<p>Animal Crossing was the best starting game for the Nintendo Switch, but it also was the best first week for any Nintendo game that is not Pokemon.
And is now the <a href="https://twitter.com/oscarlemaire/status/1242766816151306240">10th best first week</a> since 1995.
Pokemon Black/White still holds the record with more than 2,6 million games sold in 2010.</p><br>

<p>With digital sales taken into account, the game was still not able to beat the Pokemon game.</p><br>
