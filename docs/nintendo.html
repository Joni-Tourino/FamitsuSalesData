	<h3>Some stats for the Nintendo Switch in 2020:</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>The release of the Lite version keeps boosting sales of the Nintendo Switch who passed 6 million this year.
			The base line has steadily sold a similar amount every year: 3,4 million units.</li>
		<li>In November the Switch <b>already passed the total from 2019</b>, that is despite <a href="https://twitter.com/Cheesemeister3k/status/1225308371781242882">having stock issues</a> during February and at the beginning of March.</li>
		<li>Nintendo released 9 games on its hybrid console for 2020, with Animal Crossing: New Horizons being its biggest success in years.
			The launch week of Animal Crossing allowed for the console to have its best week ever, with more than <b>390,000 units</b> sold between the two models.
			Better even than the launch week of the Nintendo Switch, with 330,000.</li>
		<li>The lack of competition in the market, mainly due to a scarcity of stock for the PlayStation 5 around the world, and strong sales from Animal Crossing puts, currently, the console as the 9th most sold in Japan.
			And with 90,000 units of difference with the Super Nintendo, it'll end 2020 in 8th position.</li>
		<li>Counting both the Nintendo Switch and Lite models, 2020 will make it the third best year for a console, behind the Nintendo DS' performances in 2006 and 2007, according to the journalist Oscar Lemaire.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>For the last three weeks of the year, the Switch managed to have 29 games</h2>

<p>In the third week of December, out of the 30 best retail games, 29 were for the Nintendo Switch, while the remaining one was for the PlayStation 4.<br>
	That week, Cyberpunk 2077 was the only game not released for the Switch.
	The prior week already had 28 games for a single console.<br>
	It was the first time a console was able to do so, and it repeated the feature for the remaining two weeks of the year.
	The last two weeks of the year saw a new game released for the PS4 (Week 52) and the come back of Call of Duty (Week 53) to impede a complete chart with a single console in 2020.</p>

	<h3>Older Nintendo games keep on selling</h3>

<p>Games published in 2017 or 2018 showed to have good legs in 2020.
	Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Splatoon 2 and Super Mario Party were able to outperform their 2019 sale numbers, with Mario Kart being near 2018's total.
	The game was released in 2017 and doesn't seem to lose its pace.
	The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was released back in 2017 with the Nintendo Switch, only had a 13 % decrease in sales compared to 2019.<br>
	Of all the big names from Nintendo, Super Mario Odyssey dipped the most with a decline of 70 percent, despite being the 35th anniversary since the release of Super Mario Bros.
 This may be due to the release of a 3D compilation of past Mario games.</p><br>

	<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4772393"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div><br>

	<h4>A year of milestones</h4>

<p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate and Pokemon Sword/Shield ended the year with 4 million games sold in retail, joining Animal Crossing: New Horizons.
	For Pokemon, the numbers include the pack with the expansion pass.<br>
	While New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe finished the year above the 1 million units in retail sales.
  And if Mario Kart 8 Deluxe numbers stay similar than 2020, it may join the group by the end of 2021.<br>
  Ring Fit Adventure is the tenth Nintendo (according to their last financial results) game to reach 2 million copies sold and it did so the week before Christmas.</p>

	<h3>Ring Fit Adventure ends the year strong</h3><br>

	<ul>
			<li>Ring Fit Adventure had stock issues by the end of January, not just in Japan, and the coronavirus made things more difficult. Even with those issues, the game only left once the top 10 of the week.</li>
			<li>If it was the only game affected, this is due to the fact it comes with a Ring Con and a leg strap for each of the controllers. This means the game can only be sold in a physical format.</li>
			<li>Fitness Boxing (published by Imagineer) benefited from that problem, and sold an additional 43,000 units despite not being in the top 30 for several months earlier. They released a second one in December, who up until now has sold less than 25,000 copies.</li>
			<li>The game passed the 2 million units sold right before Christmas, and ended the year at 2,15 million.</li>

	<h3>Pikmin 3 Deluxe has already doubled the numbers of its Wii U version</h3>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/4776752"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>The first week for Pikmin 3 Deluxe was the best one in the franchise.
That's despite being an enhanced version of the Wii U version.<br>
The total sales are already double Pikmin 3, and with less than 100,000 copies to reach Pikmin.
The game has had strong sales in December, with 40,000 in the week prior to Christmas.
The game ended the year with a difference of 3,000 units with the first episode of the series.
If digital is taken into account it can already be considered as the best selling game of the franchise.</p>
