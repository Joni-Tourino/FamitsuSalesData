	<h2>The Nintendo Switch was always present in the top 10</h2>

<p>Nintendo Switch games occupied the first 10 places consistently during the entire year.
Before the release of Animal Crossing: New Horizons on week 13, many PlayStation 4 were able to stay in the top 10.
After week 13, only Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Ghost of Tsushima managed to stay more than 4 weeks in a row between the top 10.<br>
The release of new consoles was barely noticeable. Only Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition for the PlayStation 5 got into that list the week of its release.</p><br>

	<h3>Only one PlayStation 4 rises to the top 10 of retail games in 2020</h3><br>

<p>2020 most sold games (retail numbers only) is filled with Nintendo Switch games, 9 out of 10, and Nintendo published ones, 6 out of 10.
Final Fantasy VII: Remake is the only non-Switch game to make the list, and will not finish the year in 3rd position.<br>
The games are more likely to stay the same by the end of the year, with three more weeks to be counted, but the ranking will be different.
Momotaro Dentetsu and Pokemon Sword/Shield will finish ahead of Final Fantasy VII Remake, once weeks 52 and 53 are published, the list will be updated accordingly.</p><br>

<h3> Momotaro Dentetsu makes a big comeback</h3>

<p>The game that might be getting all the headlines during the holiday season is Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban!, published by Konami.
The series, created by Hudson Soft in 1988, is a board game, similar to Monopoly but with the caveat that you ride a train.
Up until Konami bought Hudson Soft in 2011, the game had an annual episode (sometimes even two a year) and was quite popular in Japan (and unknown outside the country), at least the home console versions.
The Wii version sold more than <a href="https://ludostrie.com/linfographie-du-27-novembre-2020/">700,000 copies</a>.<br>
The last game in the franchise was in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS and it was done by Nintendo, not Konami. And the last home console version, was in 2009.<br>
The first week numbers showed that the Japanese were waiting for the game, as it had the best release for the series, for a third party game (not owned by Nintendo), and the best one for Konami since Metal Gear Solid V.<br>
The game hasn't left the number one spot yet, and is still selling above 100,000 units weekly. Recently Konami announced the total sales for Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban! passed 1,5 million (counting digital sales too). This already makes it the third best game for Konami, behind two Yu-Gi-Ho games.<br>
