<p class="w3-text-black">Each week, Famitsu posts the weekly sales of software and hardware of the videogame industry in Japan.
In this page you'll be able to see the weekly sales of videogames, and which games made the top 30 in the retail market.<br>
You can also read more about how the <a href="hardware.html">consoles</a> did in 2020.
While two dedicated sections to <a href"=animalcrossing.html">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> are also available.</p><br>

<p>More than 23 million games were sold in 2020, a 5 percent increase from 2019.
	April was the best month of the year, with 3,7 million games sold.
	The major release that month was Final Fantasy VII: Remake, which helped beating March.
	That and strong sales from Animal Crossing: New Horizons during its second month on sale.</p>

	<h2>The Nintendo Switch never left the top 10</h2>

<p>Nintendo Switch games occupied the first 10 places consistently during the entire year, always representing more than half the titles.
	At five occasions, the ranking was only filed by Switch games.
	The only week where there was an even split between the Nintendo console and PlayStation 4 and 5 was when the later released in Japan. Week 46 saw 14 new games, 10 of them for Sony's systems.<br>
After Animal Crossing's release, the only PlayStation games who managed to stay more than 4 weeks in a row between the top 10 were Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Ghost of Tsushima.<br>
The release of new consoles was barely noticeable, with only Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition for the PlayStation 5 to chart between the best 10.</p><br>

<p>Since its release, Animal Crossing never left the highest positions, staying at 6 only one week.
	It's the only title being present all the weeks. Ring Fit Adventure only left the top table for a single week, despite suffering stock issues during February and March.</p>

	<h3>Only one PlayStation 4 game rises to the top 10 of retail games in 2020</h3><br>

<p>2020 most sold games (retail numbers only) is filled with Nintendo Switch games, 9 out of 10, and Nintendo published ones, 6 out of 10.
Final Fantasy VII: Remake is the only non-Switch game to make the list, and will not finish the year in 3rd position.<br>
The games are more likely to stay the same by the end of the year, with three more weeks to be counted, but the ranking will be different.
Momotaro Dentetsu and Pokemon Sword/Shield will finish ahead of Final Fantasy VII Remake, once weeks 52 and 53 are published, the list will be updated accordingly.</p><br>

<h3> Momotaro Dentetsu makes a big comeback</h3>

<p>The game that might be getting all the headlines during the holiday season is Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban!, published by Konami.
The series, created by Hudson Soft in 1988, is a board game, similar to Monopoly but with the caveat that you ride a train.
Up until Konami bought Hudson Soft in 2011, the game had an annual episode (sometimes even two a year) and was quite popular in Japan (but unknown outside the country), at least the home console versions.
The Wii version sold more than <a href="https://ludostrie.com/linfographie-du-27-novembre-2020/">700,000 copies</a>.<br>
The last game in the franchise was in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS and it was done by Nintendo, not Konami. And the last home console version, was in 2009.<br>
The first week numbers showed that the Japanese were waiting for the game, as it had the best release for the series, for a third party game for the Switch, and the best one for Konami since Metal Gear Solid V.<br>
The game hasn't left the number one spot yet, and is still selling above 100,000 units weekly.
Recently Konami announced the total sales for Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban! passed 1,5 million (counting digital sales too).
This already makes it the third best game for Konami, behind two Yu-Gi-Ho games.<br>
With two more weeks to be counted, total retail sales will put it above 1 million this year.
One month after the release, it is already the second third party game for the Nintendo Switch.
Minecraft, with more than 1,6 million retail copies sold, is the only other game above it.</p>

<h3>Ghost of Tsushima is Sony's best game this generation</h3>

<p>Despite it being a transition year for the PlayStation 4, it still had two big releases: Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us Part II.
The former had the strongest first week for a Sony made game, while the latter ended being the third one, below Death Stranding.
