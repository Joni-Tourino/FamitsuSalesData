<p class="w3-text-black">Each week, Famitsu posts the weekly sales of software and hardware of the videogame industry in Japan.
In this page you'll be able to see the weekly sales of videogames, and which games made the top 30 in the retail market.<br>
You can also read more about how the <a href="hardware.html">consoles</a> did in 2020.
Given the exceptional year <a href="animalcrossing.html">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> and <a href="nintendo.html">Nintendo</a> had, they also have a dedicated section where I go more in detail.</p><br>

<h3>Quick stats for games</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>More than 25 million games were sold in 2020, an increase of three in twenty compared to 2019.</li>
			<li>December was the best month of the year with almost one in five games sold during that month.</li>
				<li>The Holiday season helped boost sales for most games, with Momotaro Dentetsu staying above 150,000 units almost every week.</li>
				<li>Just to clarify, Famitsu considers week 53 as week 1 of 2021, but here it is still considered as the last week of 2020.</li>

	</ul>

	<h2>The Nintendo Switch never left the top 10</h2>

<p>Nintendo Switch games occupied the first 10 places consistently during the entire year, always representing more than half the titles.
	At five occasions, the ranking was only filed by Switch games.
	The only week where there was an even split between the Nintendo console and PlayStation 4 and 5 was when the later released in Japan. Week 46 saw 14 new games, 10 of them for Sony's systems.<br>
After Animal Crossing's release, the only PlayStation games who managed to stay more than 4 weeks in a row between the top 10 were Final Fantasy VII: Remake and Ghost of Tsushima.<br>
The release of new consoles was barely noticeable, with only Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales Ultimate Edition for the PlayStation 5 to chart between the best 10.</p><br>

<div class="flourish-embed flourish-bar-chart-race" data-src="visualisation/4697400"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

<p>Since its release, Animal Crossing never left the highest positions, staying at 6 only one week.
	It's the only title being present all the weeks. Ring Fit Adventure only left the top table for a single week, despite suffering stock issues during February and March.</p>

	<h3>Only one PlayStation 4 game rises to the top 10 of retail games in 2020</h3><br>

<p>2020 most sold games (retail numbers only) is filled with Nintendo Switch games, 9 out of 10, and Nintendo published ones, 6 out of 10.
Final Fantasy VII: Remake is the only non-Switch game to make the list, and it ended its course at fifth position.
It's worth saying that the game left the charts in July, but it doesn't mean it didn't sell anymore after that.<br>
Despite being released in November, Momotaro Dentetsu was able to get the bronze medal, and almost outsold Ring Fit Adventure.<br>
To put in perspective the crazy year Animal Crossing had, the game sold almost the same amount as the next 6 in the list, which includes franchises such as Pokemon or Mario Kart.</p><br>

<h3> Momotaro Dentetsu makes a big comeback</h3>

<p>The game that might be getting all the headlines during the holiday season is Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban!, published by Konami.
The series, created by Hudson Soft in 1988, is a board game, similar to Monopoly but with the caveat that you ride a train.
Up until Konami bought Hudson Soft in 2011, the game had an annual episode (sometimes even two a year) and was quite popular in Japan (but unknown outside the country), at least the home console versions.
The Wii version sold more than <a href="https://ludostrie.com/linfographie-du-27-novembre-2020/">700,000 copies</a>.<br>
The last game in the franchise was in 2016 for the Nintendo 3DS and it was done by Nintendo, not Konami. And the last home console version, was in 2009.<br>
The first week numbers showed that the Japanese were waiting for the game, as it had the best release for the series, for a third party game for the Switch, and the best one for Konami since Metal Gear Solid V.<br>
The game hasn't left the number one spot yet, and is still selling above 100,000 units weekly.
Recently Konami announced the total sales for Momotaro Dentetsu: Showa, Heisei, Reiwa mo Teiban! passed 1,5 million (counting digital sales too).
This already makes it the third best game for Konami, behind two Yu-Gi-Ho games.<br>
The game finishes the year shy of the 1,5 mark in retail sales. Konami announced at the beginning of the year that it had already sold 2 million copies, with digital sales too.
One month after the release, it is already the second third party game for the Nintendo Switch.
Minecraft, with more than 1,6 million retail copies sold, is the only other game above it.</p>

<h3>Ghost of Tsushima is Sony's best game this generation</h3>

<iframe title="The best selling Sony games on PlayStation 4" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-jCeLu" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/jCeLu/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

<p>If 2020 was Sony's worst year in hardware sales, since it entered the videogame business with the PlayStation in 1994, it ended up in a positive note in the software side.
	The PlayStation 4 had two big releases, Ghost of Tsushima and The Last of Us Part II, and a crossplatform (for the PS4 and PS5) title with Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales.
Ghost of Tsushima, created by an American studio but with a Japanese setting, had the strongest first week for a Sony made game, and ended up being the highest sold first party for the PS4.<br>
The Last of Us Part II had the third strongest launch, below Death Stranding.</p>
