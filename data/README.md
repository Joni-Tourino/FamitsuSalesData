04 July 2021 update:
You can now download (in a csv format) the monthly sales for 2021 (video games and publishers), and the total for the year. Totals might differ due to the fact I choose to follow the calendar format, instead of Famitsu's.

In this file you can download the spreadsheets for Famitsu's sales in 2020, both for <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/FamitsuSalesData/">software</a> and <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/FamitsuSalesData/hardware.html">hardware</a>. If you want to download it in a CSV format, you can do it by accessing their respectives pages. But be aware you'll only be able to download each week separately in the CSV format and it may take more time.
Even though Famitsu considers Week 53 of 2020 as Week 1 of 2021, I choose to follow the 53 week format of 2020's calendar year, otherwise the problem would repeat itself this year.
The last two weeks for the hardware file are not complete for the PlayStation 4, as I was unable to find separate numbers for those two weeks and I prefer to leave it blank instead of putting an even number in each week.
You can also download the sales of the Nintendo Switch, on a weekly basis, since its release.
