# Famitsu weekly sales in Japan

Round-up of the 2020 videogame retail market via Famitsu's charts. You can read it all through the <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/FamitsuSalesData/index.html">dedicated website</a> which is separated in four stories:

  - Software. The sales of videogames week by week, with the top 10 of the year
  - Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A game that broke many longstanding records, explained through the game itself with images
  - Nintendo. With a view to how older games are doing and how the console did in its fourth year
  - Hardware. With a look at Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft consoles. Those last two also launched their new generation of systems and you'll be able to see a comparison with the previous consoles

In the data file, you can download (in a .xlsx format) both the weekly results for videogames and consoles published by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/ranking/game-sales/">Famitsu</a> in 2020. Inside the file you'll find direct (when possible) links to the different sources used to gather the numbers on a weekly basis.
