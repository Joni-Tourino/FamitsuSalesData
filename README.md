# Famitsu weekly sales in Japan

Round-up of the 2020 video game retail market via Famitsu's charts. You can read it all through the <a href="https://joni-tourino.github.io/FamitsuSalesData/index.html">dedicated website</a> which is separated in four stories:

  - Software. The sales of video games week by week, with the top 10 of the year
  - Animal Crossing: New Horizons. A game that broke many longstanding records, explained through the game itself with images
  - Nintendo. With a view to how older games are doing and how the console did in its fourth year
  - Hardware. With a look at Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft consoles. Those last two also launched their new generation of systems and you'll be able to see a comparison with the previous consoles

In the data file, you can download (in a .xlsx format) both the weekly results for video games and consoles published by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/ranking/game-sales/">Famitsu</a> in 2020. Inside the file you'll find direct (when possible) links to the different sources used to gather the numbers on a weekly basis.

Monthly software totals for the year 2021 have been added up until March. At the moment the only information given is the name of the game, the system(s) it was released on and its total. For games released in multiple systems, the total is counted based on the game and not each system separately.
